Please copy paste exactly the code below into src/DummyComponent.tsx. Except: look at the special comments starting with `//#` and add the appropriate code there (preserve those comments). Use the correct API from the dependencies listed in package.json and respect eslint.config.mjs

```ts
//# Import the correct dependencies. Respect alphabetical order
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

type Image = {
  url: string
  width: Spring
  height: Spring
  x: Spring
}

const images = [
  'https://picsum.photos/id/10/800/1200',
  //# insert more images here using the same format, except replace id/10 with id/11, id/12, etc. all the way til id/42
]

const DummyComponent = () => {
  const [touchPosition, setTouchPosition] = useState<null | {
    startX: number
    startY: number
    currentX: number
    currentY: number
  }>(null)
  const [offsetY, setOffsetY] = useState(0)

  //# useEffect that kicks off a requestAnimationFrame loop every frame that updates the offsetY based on touch position:
  //# if we're touching, and if the delta between our original touch y and current y is greater than 80, subtract 0.1x of it from offsetY

  //# Store the initial touch position when user starts touching. Use pageX/Y

  //# Write a touch move that updates the current touch position if we're touching

  //# Clear touch position when touch ends

  const containerSizeX = document.documentElement.clientWidth
  const containerSizeY = document.documentElement.clientHeight
  const imgs = []
  let y = offsetY // y position of the first image. Incremented inside loop to become the y position of each image
  //# loop over images and push <img> components into imgs. Create a vertical stack of absolutely positioned <img ... style={{top: y, left: x}}>
  //# each image has an intrinsic width of 40px and a 9:16 aspect ratio (height is calculated based on width and ar)
  //# each image has a gap of 4 pixels between them, vertically
  //# the default x of each image is 28 gap pixels away from the right edge of the container
  //# when touching, the x of each image is calculated based on the touch position: the images near the touch point should be roughly 28 px gaps to the left of the touch point (currentX). The further away (on the y axis) the image is from the finger, the more the image's x position approaches its default position. The decay is a sine. Example: finger at bottom of screen, image at top of screen has x literallty at the default position, right aligned as per above spec. Image(s) near finger is on the left of the finger. Everything in-between is interpolated according to the sine (put a factor of 0.7)
  //# there's also a size scaling factor applied to each image (only when touching): 1.5 when near the finger, 0.2 when further away.

  return (
    <div
      //# Hook up the touch events we've declared
      style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', height: '100%', overflow: 'hidden' }}
    >
      {imgs}
      {touchPosition && (
        //# Render a 30px red transparent circle div centered at touch position
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

const root = document.createElement('div')
//# add root it to document.body, and render the component into it
```
