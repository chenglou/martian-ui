# Remove Browser UI

When your app is bookmarked on home screen, here's how to remove the surrounding browser UI:

- If you have a `manifest.json` file (see Manifest File section below), add `"display": "standalone"` to it (iOS only supports `"standalone"` and `"browser"`).
- Otherwise, add `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` and `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` to your HTML `<head>`.

The latter way has a drawback: for the bookmarked app, the browser UI will only hide when the URL is what the user bookmarked. So if you change URL by navigating to another page (including navigating to some external site for e.g. login, payment), the UI will show up again. There's currently no solution to this.

Addendum: with the latter `meta` tags method, technically, with our routing system, we can detect whether we're in bookmarked mode with `window.navigator.standalone === true`, and simply never switch URL again apart from the needed third-party URLs. Since our URL source of truth is our internal data structure and not the address bar, this doesn't break things (the one time we treat address bar as source of truth is when the user operates on it, which isn't possible in browser UI-less mode).

# Status Bar

`<meta name="theme-color" content="rgbColorHere">`. Works only in standalone display mode.

# Manifest File

The [Web Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) `manifest.json` file declares attributes about the webapp: its name on the phone/tablet's home screen, icon, its starting URL, etc. We specify it with `<link rel="manifest" href="path/to/manifest.json" />`.

Many of the manifest attributes have their HTML `<meta ... />` tag counterparts. Whenever possible, we prefer the `meta` tags for 2 reasons:

- Philosophically, we'd like to preserve as much runtime dynanism as possible (aka "late binding"). For example, maybe the theme color (status bar) varies depending on the page shown, or scroll position. Then we'd programmatically change that `meta` tag, which wouldn't be possible if we wrote a constant in `manifest.json`.
- `manifest.json` is yet another file that's sometime not refreshed due to browser's over-aggressive caching. The fewer attributes we stuff in it, the less development & production stateless we have to deal with.

However, we do need `manifest.json` for one single attribute: `start_url`, which specifies the URL to open when the webapp is opened from the home screen. This one doesn't have a `meta` tag counterpart.

But the simple presence of the manifest file **always overrides** the tag `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` and `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` on iOS. So to ensure our app doesn't have the browser UI when bookmarked, we need to specify `"display": "standalone"` in the manifest too, in which case we should avoid redundancy and remove those 2 meta tags.

Note that `start_url` and `display`\*, contrary to most others attributes, are only read once, when the webapp's bookmarked on home screen. Even if their value changes, the bookmark won't pick them up.

\* This applies to `name` too (and its `meta` counterpart `apple-mobile-web-app-title` and `mobile-web-app-title`).

# Events

Traditional web frameworks are built around the assumption that user input events are:

- sparse (happens only once in a while)
- precise (e.g. a mouse click on some exact pixel position)
- discrete (a click's a click; no input's _dragged_ out over time)
- rarely concurrent (e.g. no other input happens while mouse is down)

If these overly simplistic assumptions led to simpler event handling code, they'd have been more defensible. In reality, most apps' event handling code isn't even _that_ much simpler (usually a bunch of logic right inside the event callback, for meager convenience), while also leading to various unreadable antipatterns & bugs when the assumptions above are violated.

One small change can fix all of the problems above _and_ lead to cleaner code organization at the same time. Whenever possible, in the event callbacks, _only_ retain the event that happened, then only call some render scheduler helper. The pattern roughly looks like this:

```ts
const events = {
  pointerdown: null,
  keydown: null,
}
window.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e) => {
  events.pointerdown = e
  scheduleRender()
})
window.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  events.keydown = e
  scheduleRender()
})

function scheduleRender() {
  if (renderAlreadyScheduled) return

  // ...actual render logic here.
  calculateSomeState(events.pointerdown, events.keydown)

  // Then near the end:

  // reset events after this render, or keep some if needed for the next frame
  events.pointerdown = null
  events.keydown = null
}
```

The subtle difference is that instead of handling a particular event's logic inside its event callback, we record that it happened (here `events`), then we get to have holistic knowledge of all the events of this frame inside `scheduleRender`. For the cost of a tiny indirection, logic requiring knowing various event states at the same time can happen, enabling cool new UX (or simpler code for existing UX):

- you get to order the importance of a key press relative to a concurrent (potentially conflicting) mouse click
- resolve one tap while another finger is held down
- Press a key while mouse's hovering over a special section for pro user actions
- Two directional controls on a game pad composing into a new action
