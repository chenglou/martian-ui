# Remove Browser UI

When your app is bookmarked on home screen, here's how to remove the surrounding browser UI:

- If you have a `manifest.json` file (see Manifest File section below), add `"display": "standalone"` to it (iOS only supports `"standalone"` and `"browser"`).
- Otherwise, add `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` and `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` to your HTML `<head>`.

The latter way has a drawback: for the bookmarked app, the browser UI will only hide when the URL is what the user bookmarked. So if you change URL by navigating to another page (including navigating to some external site for e.g. login, payment), the UI will show up again. There's currently no solution to this.

Addendum: with the latter `meta` tags method, technically, with our routing system, we can detect whether we're in bookmarked mode with `window.navigator.standalone === true`, and simply never switch URL again apart from the needed third-party URLs. Since our URL source of truth is our internal data structure and not the address bar, this doesn't break things (the one time we treat address bar as source of truth is when the user operates on it, which isn't possible in browser UI-less mode).

# Status Bar

`<meta name="theme-color" content="rgbColorHere">`. Works only in standalone display mode.

# Manifest File

The [Web Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) `manifest.json` file declares attributes about the webapp: its name on the phone/tablet's home screen, icon, its starting URL, etc. We specify it with `<link rel="manifest" href="path/to/manifest.json" />`.

Many of the manifest attributes have their HTML `<meta ... />` tag counterparts. Whenever possible, we prefer the `meta` tags for 2 reasons:

- Philosophically, we'd like to preserve as much runtime dynanism as possible (aka "late binding"). For example, maybe the theme color (status bar) varies depending on the page shown, or scroll position. Then we'd programmatically change that `meta` tag, which wouldn't be possible if we wrote a constant in `manifest.json`.
- `manifest.json` is yet another file that's sometime not refreshed due to browser's over-aggressive caching. The fewer attributes we stuff in it, the less development & production stateless we have to deal with.

However, we do need `manifest.json` for one single attribute: `start_url`, which specifies the URL to open when the webapp is opened from the home screen. This one doesn't have a `meta` tag counterpart.

But the simple presence of the manifest file **always overrides** the tag `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` and `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />` on iOS. So to ensure our app doesn't have the browser UI when bookmarked, we need to specify `"display": "standalone"` in the manifest too, in which case we should avoid redundancy and remove those 2 meta tags.

Note that `start_url` and `display`\*, contrary to most others attributes, are only read once, when the webapp's bookmarked on home screen. Even if their value changes, the bookmark won't pick them up.

\* This applies to `name` too (and its `meta` counterpart `apple-mobile-web-app-title` and `mobile-web-app-title`).

# Events

Traditional webapp patterns recommend putting your event handling logic right inside the event callback

```tsx
function handleClick(e) {
  /* everything here */
}
;<div onClick={handleClick}> ... </div>
```

This is convenient for simple cases, built around the assumption that events are:

- sparse (happens only once in a while)
- precise (e.g. a mouse click on some exact pixel position)
- discrete (a click's a click; no input's _dragged_ out over time)
- rarely concurrent (e.g. no other input happens while mouse is down)

As event handling requirements grow, you can refactor to such pattern:

```ts
const events = {
  pointerdown: null,
  keydown: null,
}
window.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e) => {
  events.pointerdown = e
  scheduleRender()
})
window.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  events.keydown = e
  scheduleRender()
})

function scheduleRender() {
  if (renderAlreadyScheduled) return
  renderAlreadyScheduled = true

  // ...actual render logic here.
  if (events.pointerdown) doSomething1()
  if (events.keydown) doSomething2()
  calculateSomeOtherState(events.pointerdown, events.keydown) // this is now possible

  // Then near the end, reset events after this render, or keep some if needed for the next frame
  events.pointerdown = null
  events.keydown = null
}
```

Instead of handling a particular event's logic inside its event callback, we _only_ retain the event payload (`e`), then _only_ schedule a render, then process all events holistically inside the render. For the cost of this tiny indirection, logic requiring knowing various event states at the same time (`calculateSomeOtherState`) can happen, enabling cool new UX (or cleaner code for existing UX):

- you get to order the importance of a key press relative to a concurrent (potentially conflicting) mouse click
- resolve one tap while another finger is held down
- Press a key while mouse's hovering over a special section for pro user actions
- Two directional controls on a game pad composing into a new action

This colocation of disparate events costs so little that we default to this pattern, for easier code evolution.
